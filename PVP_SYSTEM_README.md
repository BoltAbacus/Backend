## üì° API Endpoints

### PVP Room Management
```
POST /createPVPRoom/
POST /joinPVPRoom/

POST /getPVPGameResult/
```

### User Experience
```
POST /getUserExperience/
```

### WebSocket Endpoint
```

```

## üéØ Game Flow

### 1. Room Creation
1. Student creates room with settings:
   - Max players (2-4)
   - Number of questions (5-20)
   - Time per question (15-60 seconds)
   - Level/Class/Topic selection
2. System generates unique 6-character room code
3. Creator automatically joins the room

### 2. Room Joining
1. Other students enter the room code
2. System validates room availability
3. Players join and see room details

### 3. Game Preparation
1. All players must mark themselves as "Ready"
2. Room creator can start game when all players are ready
3. 3-2-1 countdown begins

### 4. Gameplay
1. Questions appear one by one with timer
2. Players submit answers in real-time
3. Scores update immediately
4. System tracks correct answers and time taken

### 5. Game Completion
1. All questions completed
2. Winner determined by score (then time)
3. Experience points awarded to winner
4. Results displayed to all players

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd "BoltAbacus Copy"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Setup Script
```bash
python setup_pvp.py
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration
Update the frontend API URL to point to your local backend:
```javascript
// In frontend .env file
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/boltabacusdb

# Redis (for production WebSocket scaling)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Room Code Generation
- 6 characters: Uppercase letters + numbers
- Example: "ABC123", "XYZ789"
- Automatically checked for uniqueness

### Experience System
- **Level Calculation**: `level = (XP // 100) + 1`
- **XP to Next Level**: `100 - (XP % 100)`
- **Win Reward**: 50 XP
- **Future Features**: Streak bonuses, achievement rewards

## üß™ Testing

### API Testing
```bash
# Create a room
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/createPVPRoom/ \
  -H "AUTH-TOKEN: your_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"max_players": 2, "number_of_questions": 10, "time_per_question": 30}'

# Join a room
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/joinPVPRoom/ \
  -H "AUTH-TOKEN: your_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"room_id": "ABC123"}'
```

### WebSocket Testing
```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/pvp/ABC123/');

// Join room
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'join_room',
  user_id: 123
}));

// Mark ready
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'player_ready',
  user_id: 123
}));
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

3. **Achievements**: Unlockable achievements
4. **Tournaments**: Multi-round competitions
5. **Leaderboards**: Global and class rankings
6. **Spectator Mode**: Watch ongoing games
7. **Replay System**: Review past games

### Technical Improvements
1. **Redis Integration**: For production WebSocket scaling

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**

   - Check database connection

3. **Room Creation Fails**
   - Verify user is a student
   - Check authentication token
   - Ensure database is accessible

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in settings.py:
```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
        },
    },
}
```
